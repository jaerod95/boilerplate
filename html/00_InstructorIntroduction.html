<p>I currently teach at Spanish Fork Junior High, where I have been teaching for the past 17 years. I have really enjoyed teaching at this level, and I am currently head of the math department. I love helping others to succeed. I was teacher of the year for our school in 2009 and have been teacher of the month at our school multiple times. </p>


<p>I graduated from Brigham Young University with a double major in mathematics education and computer science teaching. I have earned endorsements in keyboarding and information technology as well. I love working with computers and am often seen helping my fellow teachers with their technology issues. I also help out with 4-H and have been the state 4-H after-school teacher of the year. I have been working with our school&rsquo;s musical productions for the past 15 years, and for 10 years I have worked with the district science fair. I have also been our school&rsquo;s yearbook advisor for the past 12 years.</p>

<p>Math is found in so many places and so many different ways. I am excited to help you see how you can apply it in your own world.</p>
