            <h2>Format</h2>
            
            <p>Now that you have successfully completed each of the units in this course, it&rsquo;s time to prepare for the final exam. This will be a comprehensive test composed of questions from the six units. The test will be made up of thirty-two multiple-choice questions. The questions will focus on the main objectives of Eighth-Grade Math.</p>
            
            <h2>Taking the Exam</h2>
            
            <p>There is no time limit for the final exam, and a calculator is allowed as long as no notes are stored in it. This is a closed book exam, so study aids and notes are not permitted.</p>

<p>Since you need to finish the final exam in one sitting, remember to give yourself adequate time. Try to get enough rest the night before the test so you will not be tired. Most importantly, try not to be nervous! Even though you do need to pass the 
final exam with a score of 60 percent or higher to pass the course, you will be successful if you have prepared well.</p>

<h2>What You Should Review</h2>

<p>In order to best prepare for the final exam, you need to spend time reviewing each of the unit lessons thoroughly. Revisit the reading assignments for each lesson to be sure you remember the important concepts from the textbook. If any videos were especially helpful, view them again as a refresher.</p>

<p>First, go back and review the highlighted vocabulary terms. Make sure you can not only explain these terms to someone else, but give an example of each one as well. Also study the Self Check for each lesson in the course.</p>

<p>Next, go back through each of the review assignments and unit quizzes. If there are any problems you are not sure how to do, try to find a similar problem in the textbook. Pay attention to the steps used to solve the problem.</p>
