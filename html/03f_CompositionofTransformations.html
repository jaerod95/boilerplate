		  	<h1>Composition of Transformations</h1>			
            
           <p>Now that we have examined how to do various transformations, we are going to figure out their <i>composition</i>, or which transformations have been used to create the image. We often use these techniques in order to show congruence. If we can move one figure onto another and show them to have the same angles and same length of sides, then the figures are congruent.</p>

<p>One of the most common types of composition of transformations is called the <i>glide reflection</i>. This happens when a figure is reflected and then translated. One example of this would be footprints across the sand, with each footprint being a mirror of each other and then moved forward.</p>

<p>In figuring out which transformations have been used, there are a few things that we can use to help us.</p>

<ul>

<li>See if the figure has been moved up and down and side to side without changing its orientation. This would indicate some sort of translation.</li>

<li>See if the figure has a mirror image. This would generally indicate some sort of reflection.</li>

<li>See if the figure has been turned. This would indicate some sort of rotation.</li>

<li>See if the figure has gotten bigger or smaller. This would indicate some sort of dilation.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Example 1</h2>

<p>Find the transformations that create this image from the pre-image.</p>


             <div class="center-figure" id="MediaElement3">
				<div>
					<img src="../Media/Images/Composition2-1.jpg" alt="Two triangles on a graph. The vertices of the first triangle are A (1,1), B (-1,1), and C (0,1). The vertices of the second triangle are A&prime; (3,3), B&prime; (-1,3), C&prime; (1,0)." title="Two triangles on a graph. The vertices of the first triangle are A (1,1), B (-1,1), and C (0,1). The vertices of the second triangle are A&prime; (3,3), B&prime; (-1,3), C&prime; (1,0).  ">
					
					
				</div>
			</div> 
            
            <p>We see that this figure has not changed its orientation, but it is bigger and has moved. This would indicate that there is a dilation and possibly a translation.</p>
            
            <p>As we compare the lengths of the sides we see that it has doubled in size, so there is a dilation with a scale factor of 2.</p>
            
            
                 <div class="center-figure" id="MediaElement3">
				<div>
					<img src="../Media/Images/Composition2-2.jpg" alt="Two triangles on a graph. The vertices of the first triangle are A (1,1), B (-1,1), and C (0,1). The second triangle is a dilation of the first by a factor of 2. The vertices of the second triangle are (2,2), (-2,2), and (0,-2)." title="Two triangles on a graph. The vertices of the first triangle are A (1,1), B (-1,1), and C (0,1). The second triangle is a dilation of the first by a factor of 2. The vertices of the second triangle are (2,2), (-2,2), and (0,-2).">
					
					
				</div>
			</div> 
            
            <p>After performing the dilation, we see that every vertex is right 1 and up 1, so there must be a translation of (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) â†’ (<i>x</i> + 1, <i>y</i> + 1). This gives us the image in the original figure.</p>
            
            <h2>Example 2</h2>
            
            <p>Find the transformations that create this image from the pre-image.</p>
            
            
               
                 <div class="center-figure" id="MediaElement3">
				<div>
					<img src="../Media/Images/Composition3-1.jpg" alt="An image of two triangles on a graph. The first triangle has vertices of A (-1,1), B (1,2), and C (0,4). The second triangle is a transformation of the first, with vertices at A&prime; (1,-1), B&prime; (2,1), and C&prime; (4,0)." title="An image of two triangles on a graph. The first triangle has vertices of A (-1,2), B (1,2), and C (0,4). The second triangle is a transformation of the first, with vertices at A&prime; (1,-1), B&prime; (2,1), and C&prime; (4,0).">
					
					
				</div>
			</div> 
            
          <p> In this figure we see that the orientation has changed, which indicates some sort of rotation. The direction has also changed, indicating some sort of reflection.</p>

<p>Since the figure is now pointing to the right we first look at 90-degree clockwise rotation on the pre-image.</p>



            <div class="center-figure" id="MediaElement3">
				<div>
					<img src="../Media/Images/Composition3-2.jpg" alt="An image of two triangles on a graph. The first triangle has vertices of A (-1,1), B (1,2), and C (0,4). The second triangle is a transformation of the first, with vertices at (1,1), (2,-1), and (4,0)." title="An image of two triangles on a graph. The first triangle has vertices of A (-1,2), B (1,2), and C (0,4). The second triangle is a transformation of the first, with vertices at (1,1), (2,-1), and (4,0).">
					
					
				</div>
			</div> 
            
            
            <p>
Then we notice that the image creates a mirror image across the x-axis with the figure we are trying to create, making this the next transformation.</p>
