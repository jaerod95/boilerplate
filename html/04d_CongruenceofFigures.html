		  	<h1>4.4: Congruence of Figures</h1>
            <p>Two figures are congruent if every corresponding side and every corresponding angle are the same from one figure to the next. The symbol for congruence is &cong;.</p>

            <p>With the exception of dilation, the transformations we have learned are <i>rigid transformations</i>, meaning that the sides remain unchanged and the angles remain unchanged during the transformation. This means that we can use the rigid transformations&mdash;reflection, rotation, and translation&mdash;to show that two figures are congruent. </p>
