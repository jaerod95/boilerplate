		  	<h1>Analyze Data Distributions</h1>
			
            
            <p>When we look at different sets of data, we notice that they gather together in different ways. We can analyze the data based on how it is gathered. The arrangement of data on a number line is called a <i>distribution</i>.</p>
            
            <p>Distribution terms:</p>
            
            <p><i>Cluster</i>: When all of the information is grouped together, it is called a cluster.</p>
            <p><i>Peak</i>: When you have the most points of data at one value, you have a peak.</p>
            <p><i>Gap</i>: When you see a cluster of data around one set of values, and then a cluster of data around another set of values with a space in between, the space is called a gap.</p>
            <p><i>Outlier</i>: When you have a few or even one data point that is far away from all the other values, it is called an outlier.</p>
            <p><i>Symmetric</i>: When the the distribution of data is the same on the left and the right, it is called symmetric. If there is an outlier in the data, then the data is not symmetric.</p>
            
            <p>Now that you know the vocabulary, look at some examples.</p>
            
            <h2>Example 1</h2>
            
            <p>Examine the graph and find the symmetry, clusters, gaps, peaks, and outliers.</p>

The x-axis is measured by increments of 1 beginning at 146 and ending at 162. The y-axis is measured by increments of 1 beginning at 0 and ending at 7. Interpretations of the data follow the image." title="An image of a bar graph with data regarding a survey of students' weights.

            <p>In this case, we notice the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
            
            <li>There is a cluster between 146 and 154.</li>
            <li>The data has a peak at 150.</li>
            <li>There is a significant gap between 154 and 162.</li>
            <li>There is an outlier at 162.</li>
            
            </ul>
            
            <p>If we remove the outlier, then the distribution is roughly symmetric; however, with the outlier in place, the distribution is not symmetric.</p>
            <p>Why does it matter whether the data is symmetric? Different measures have to be used to analyze data that is not symmetric. For now, you will not need to know which measures to use; just remember to analyze whether the distribution is symmetric or non-symmetric.</p>
