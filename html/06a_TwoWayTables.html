		  	<h1>Two-Way Tables</h1>
            
            <p>When we have two different things to compare, we need to find a way to place those two ideas in a form that can be examined. One of these ways is using a two-way table, which places the information that we know about something across the top and the information about something else we know down the side. Then we combine the two ideas in the intersecting boxes in order to make some conclusions.</p>
            
            <h2>Example 1</h2>
            
            <p>John and Philip are working on studying the students in their class. John is looking at the students with smartphones, and Philip is looking at the students who have an Xbox. John found that of the 50 students, 45 of them had smartphones. Philip discovered that 12 of them had an Xbox. They also noted that 10 of the students had both a smartphone and an Xbox. </p>
            
            <p>To create a two-way table showing their data, we set up the table with labels for the information we know. The information about the students and smartphones goes across the top, and the information about students and Xbox goes down the side.</p>

            <p>Next, we add in the information that we know: the total number of students with smartphones, the total number of students with an Xbox, the number of students who have both an Xbox and a smartphone, and the total number of students. We put all those numbers into the table:</p>

            <p>At this point, we use subtraction to figure out the other information.</p>

            <li>If there are 12 students with an Xbox, and there are 50 students, then 38 of them do not have an Xbox.</li>
            <li>If there are 50 students, and 45 of them have smartphones, then 5 of them do not have smartphones.</li>
            
            </ul>
            
            <p>Finally, if 2 students don&rsquo;t have a smartphone but do have an Xbox, and there are 5 total students without a smartphone, then there must be 3 students left that don&rsquo;t have a smartphone and don&rsquo;t have an Xbox.</p>
