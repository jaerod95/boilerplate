              <p><b>Corresponding Angles:</b>  &lt;1 and &lt;5, &lt;2 and &lt;6, &lt;3 and &lt;7, &lt;4 and &lt;8
          
          <br>Corresponding angles are <i>congruent</i> (they have equal measures).
         
         
          <p><b>Alternate Interior Angles:</b> &lt;3 and &lt;6, &lt;4 and &lt;5
          <br>These angles are on the inside of the parallel lines, and on opposite sides of the transversal.
          <br>Alternate interior angles are congruent.</p>
          
          <p><b>Alternate Exterior Angles:</b> &lt;1 and &lt;8, &lt;2 and &lt;7
          <br>These angles are on the outside of the parallel lines, and on the opposite sides of the transversal. Alternate exterior angles are congruent.</p>
          <p>When two angles form a straight line (a linear pair), they are <i>supplementary</i>. This means that the measures of their angles added together are 180 degrees. For example, &lt;1 and &lt;3 are supplementary.</p>
