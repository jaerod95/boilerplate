		  	<h1>Two-Way Table Relative Frequencies</h1>
			
            
            <p>Now that we know how to make two-way tables, we can begin to examine those tables by using <i>relative frequency</i>, which means how often something occurs when something else is already occurring.</p>
            
            
            <h2>Example 1</h2>
            
            <p></p>
            
            
            <table>
             
         	<tr scope="row">
            <th> </th>

            <th>Students with a smartphone</th>
            <th>Students without a smartphone</th>
            <th>Total</th>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <th scope="column">Students with an Xbox</th>
            <td scope="row">10</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>12</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <th>Students without an Xbox</th>
            <td scope="row">35</td>

            <th>Total</th>
            <td scope="row">45</td>

            </table>
            
            
            <p class="caption">Table 6.4: Two-Way Table with Data</p>
            
           
            <p>First of all, we look at the relative frequencies by row. The relative frequency is calculated by taking the amount in the row and dividing it by the total of that row.</p>
            
            
            
            <table>
             
         	<tr scope="row">
            <th> </th>

            <th>Students with a smartphone</th>
            <th>Students without a smartphone</th>
            <th>Total</th>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <th scope="column">Students with an Xbox</th>
            <td scope="row">10, 10/12 &asymp; .83 </td>
            <td>2, 2/12, &asymp; .17</td>
            <td>12, 12/12 &asymp; 1.00</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <th>Students without an Xbox</th>
            <td scope="row">35, 35/38 &asymp; .92</td>
            <td>3, 3/38 &asymp; .08</td>
            <td>38, 38/38 &asymp; 1.00</td>
            </tr>
           

            </table>
            
            <p class="caption">Table 6.5: Relative Frequency by Row</p>
            
            <p>As we calculate the relative frequency by row, we are calculating the frequency from a piece of information already given. For example, in the first row, we are calculating the frequency of a student having or not having a smartphone if we already know they have an Xbox. We learn that students are more likely to have a smartphone if they already have an Xbox.</p>
            
            <p>In the second row, we learn that if students do not have an Xbox, they are still most likely going to have a smartphone. Another way of saying it is that if you pick a random student out of the class, and you find that the student does not have an Xbox, then there is a 92% probability that the student does have a smartphone.</p>
            
            <p>Now we create the frequency by column:</p>
            
            
            
            <table>
             
         	<tr scope="row">
            <th> </th>

            <th>Students with a smartphone</th>
            <th>Students without a smartphone</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <th scope="column">Students with an Xbox</th>
            <td scope="row">10</td>
            <td>2</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <th>Students without an Xbox</th>
            <td scope="row">35</td>
            <td>3</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <th>Total</th>
            <td scope="row">45</td>
            <td>5</td>

            </table>
            
            <p class="caption">Table 6.6: Relative Frequency by Column</p>
            
            <p>Then we divide the amount in each box by the total.</p>
            
            <table>
             
            <tr scope="row">
            <th> </th>

            <th>Students with a smartphone</th>
            <th>Students without a smartphone</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <th scope="column">Students with an Xbox</th>
            <td scope="row">10/45 &asymp; .22</td>
            <td>2/5 &asymp; .4</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <th>Students without an Xbox</th>
            <td scope="row">35/45 &asymp; .78</td>
            <td>3/5 &asymp; .6</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <th>Total</th>

            </table>
            
            <p class="caption">Table 6.7: Total Relative Frequency</p>
            
            <p>From this we learn that if a student has a smartphone, they are more likely not to have an Xbox. However, if the students do not have a smartphone, there is a 40% chance that they do have an Xbox.</p>
