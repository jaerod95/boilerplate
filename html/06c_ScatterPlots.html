		  	<h1>Scatter Plots</h1>
            
            <p>A second way to look at two different types of data is to put the information into a scatter plot, which looks at each individual and compares how they answered two different types of questions. This is used to see if one idea relates to another idea.</p>
            
            <p>For example, if you are trying to determine if the amount of studying relates to the score on a test, you would start by asking each person two questions:</p>
            
            <ul>
            
            <li>How much studying did you do for the test (in hours)?</li>
            <li>What was your score on the test (as a percent)?</li>
            
            </ul>
            
            <p>Then you would create a table showing those values:</p>
            
            <table>
            <tr scope="row">
            <th>Amount of Studying (hrs)</th>
            <th>Score (%)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr scope="row">
            <td align="center">2</td>
            <td align="center">78</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr scope="row">
            <td align="center">10</td>
            <td align="center">100</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr scope="row">
            <td align="center">6</td>
            <td align="center">85</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr scope="row">
            <td align="center">7</td>
            <td align="center">89</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr scope="row">
            <td align="center">9</td>
            <td align="center">93</td>
            </tr>
            
            </table>
            
            <p class="caption">Table 6.8: Table with Values</p>
            
            <p>Once you have these data values, you can create the scatter plot. First you would create a number line across the bottom showing the amount of studying that a person did. This is the x-axis of your scatter plot.
Then you would create a second number line going up the side showing their score on the test. This is the y-axis of your scatter plot.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
            

			<p>Remember that you need to set up the number lines to include all the data points. You do not have to start at zero on either the x- or the y-axis, but it helps to set up the equation that you use. Next put a point or dot on every point in your chart in the corresponding place on the graph.</p>

            <p>If one idea relates to another idea, there is an association or correlation. From this scatter plot, we see that as the amount of studying goes up, the score also goes up. This is called a positive association or positive correlation. Since we see that the points form a straight line, or close to a straight line, we note that it is also a linear association.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the associations we will see:</p>
            
            <p><b>Positive Association:</b> When the values on the x-axis go up, the values on the y-axis go up as well.
            <br><b>Negative Association:</b> When the values on the x-axis go up, the values on the y-axis go down.
            <br><b>No Association:</b> When there is no obvious pattern between the x and the y values, there is no association.</p>
            
            <h2>Example 1</h2>
            
            <p>The following data was gathered by a student throughout the springtime with respect to the temperature outside and the amount of snow on the ground.</p>

            <p>Now we need to create a scatter plot and interpret the results. First we need to create a scatter plot with the temperature on the x-axis and the depth of the snow on the y-axis.</p>

The x-axis is labeled as  &ldquo;Temperature (degrees Celsius)&rdquo; and is measured in increments of 5 ranging from 0 to 20. The y-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Depth of snow (inches)&rdquo; and is measured in increments of 2 beginning at 0 and ending at 18. The data is plotted at the following points: (1,15), 3,14.5), (3,14), (7,12), (6,11), (10,9), (15,5), and (17,1).">

            <p>We note that there is a negative association in the graph. This means as the temperature increases, the depth of the snow decreases. We also note that it seems that the data lies in the shape of a line, making it linear.</p>
