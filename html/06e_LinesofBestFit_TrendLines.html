		  	<h1>Lines of Best Fit (Trend Lines)</h1>
			
            
            <p>One of the ways that we can make predictions on a set of bivariate data is to create a line of best fit on a scatter plot. A line of best fit (or trend line) is a line that can be drawn that is close to the data points that are actually given in a scatter plot. Look at the scatter plot that we created in lesson 6.3:</p>
            
            <div class="center-block full-column" id="MediaElement3">
				<div>
					<img src="../Media/Images/scatter-plot-2.jpg" alt="A scatter plot with x- and y-axes labeled. The x-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Amount of Studying (hrs).&rdquo; The x-axis is labeled in increments of 2 ranging from 0 to 12. The y-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Score (%).&rdquo; This axis is labeled in increments of 20 ranging from 0 to 100. The data is plotted at the following points: (2,78), (6,85), (7,89), (9,93), and (10,100)." title="A scatter plot with x- and y-axes labeled. The x-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Amount of Studying (hrs).&rdquo; The x-axis is labeled in increments of 2 ranging from 0 to 12. The y-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Score (%).&rdquo; This axis is labeled in increments of 20 ranging from 0 to 100. The data is plotted at the following points: (2,78), (6,85), (7,89), (9,93), and (10,100).">
					
				</div>
			</div>
            
            <p>We then draw a line that is close to the data points that are given.</p>
            
            <div class="center-block full-column" id="MediaElement3">
				<div>
					<img src="../Media/Images/scatter-plot-4.jpg" alt="A scatter plot with x- and y-axes labeled.

The data is plotted at the following points: (2,78), (6,85), (7,89), (9,93), and (10,100).There is a line of best fit drawn through the data." title="A scatter plot with x- and y-axes labeled. The x-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Amount of Studying (hrs).&rdquo; The x-axis is labeled in increments of 2 ranging from 0 to 12. The y-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Score (%).&rdquo; This axis is labeled in increments of 20 ranging from 0 to 100. The data is plotted at the following points: (2,78), (6.5,85), (7,89), (9,93), and (10,100).There is a line of best fit drawn through the data.">
					
				</div>
			</div>
            
            <p>The line helps in showing us that it has a positive association, since the slope of the line is positive. We can also use the line to make predictions about what will happen. For example, we can predict that if we do no studying at all, we will get about a 70% on the test. We can also predict that if we study for 12 hours we will get a 100% on the test.</p>
            
            <p>Look at the other example from lesson 6.3. Again, we will draw a line of best fit for the data and then see if we can make a few predictions based on that trend line.</p>
            
            <p>First we start with the original scatter plot:</p>
            
            <div class="center-block full-column" id="MediaElement3">
				<div>
					<img src="../Media/Images/scatter-plot-3.jpg" alt="An image of a scatter plot. The x-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Temperature (degrees Celsius)&rdquo; and is measured in increments of 5 ranging from 0 to 20. The y-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Depth of snow (inches)&rdquo; and is measured in increments of 2 beginning at 0 and ending at 18. The data is plotted at the following points: (1,15), 3,14.5), (3,14), (7,12), (6,11), (10,9), (15,5), and (17,1)." title="An image of a scatter plot.

The y-axis is labeled as &ldquo;Depth of snow (inches)&rdquo; and is measured in increments of 2 beginning at 0 and ending at 18. The data is plotted at the following points: (1,15), 3,14.5), (3,14), (7,12), (6,11), (10,9), (15,5), and (17,1).">
					
				</div>
			</div>
            
            
            <p>Then we draw a line that best fits the data:</p>
            
            
            <div class="center-block full-column" id="MediaElement3">

				</div>
			</div>
            
            <p>From this trend line, we can predict that there will be no snow when the temperature reaches 20 degrees Celsius, and it will have 16.5 inches of snow when the temperature outside is 0 degrees Celsius. One thing to remember about trend lines is that they are predictors only, and the actual results would have to be measured.</p>
